# The transport

`sokar-message-transport-matrix` is a program Sokar runs on the host, over files. It carries a message the
filter let through into the project's room, and brings the room's messages back for Sokar to deliver. It
never reads a message: what may pass is the filter's, and who gets what is Sokar's. This page is the
contract, for whoever works on Sokar or on the transport.

## Configuration

From the environment, never from an argument:

| Variable | What |
|---|---|
| `SOKAR_MATRIX_HOMESERVER` | The homeserver's URL: `https`, or `http` only on this machine's loopback (78 otherwise) |
| `SOKAR_MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | The account the transport acts as: a task's, or for `poll` the project's relay |
| `SOKAR_MATRIX_CA_FILE` | PEM certificates trusted besides the built-in authorities |
| `SOKAR_MATRIX_TLS_VERIFY` | `on` (default) or `off`, for development only; `off` warns on stderr at every start |
| `XDG_STATE_HOME`, else `HOME` | Where `poll` keeps its position: `…/sokar/transports/matrix/` |

- **No redirect is followed** (76), so the token reaches no other server.
- **A certificate that is not trusted is 78**, before any request. The built-in authorities are fixed
  when the executable is built: a CA added to the machine's store changes nothing, `SOKAR_MATRIX_CA_FILE`
  does. A CA file together with `off` is refused.

## The lifecycle

Sokar runs these to make a project's conversation, and keeps what they print without reading it. Each
takes the project's settings (`mail.transports.matrix`) as JSON on stdin, and the secrets Sokar kept as
its environment; each prints one JSON object.

| Verb | What it does | What it prints |
|---|---|---|
| `setup --project P [--loopback-only]` | Starts the local homeserver if no `homeserver` is set; registers `@sokar`, the administrator; makes the room `#sokar-<P>` (invite-only, unlisted) and the relay `@sokar-relay-<P>` | `account` (the administrator's token), `secrets` (the relay's environment, for `poll`), `conversation` (the room id), `reaches` (a JSON array of `"host:port"`, e.g. `["127.0.0.1:8008"]`) |
| `enroll --project P --task T [--display N] [--loopback-only]` | The account `@<T>` in the room, shown as the nickname `N` (1 to 64 characters, no control characters, `@` or `:`) or else as `T`; enrolled again with another, renamed, its id kept | `secrets` (the task's environment), `address` (its user id) |
| `retire --project P --task T` | Deactivates `@<T>` | `{}` |
| `join --project P --person N [--reset] [--loopback-only]` | A person's account in the room, with a new password; a second join is refused (77) without `--reset` | `login` and `shown`; the password is printed once, and the admin-room command that set it and its reply are redacted at once |
| `clear --project P` | Deactivates every account in the project's room (its tasks', its relay's, its people's), deletes the room with its alias, and forgets the relay's poll position | `removed` (what went) and `kept` (each `what` and `why`) |
| `clear` | The account's own homeserver once no project uses it: stops and disables it, removes its container and database, its port and registration token, and every poll position. Reads no settings | the same |
| `settings` | Checks the settings as a draft, with no network and no environment | `{"refused": […], "warnings": […]}` |

- **Settings:** `homeserver`, `ca_file` (absolute), `tls_verify` (`on`/`off`). Anything else is refused (78).
- **The printed `secrets` always name `SOKAR_MATRIX_CA_FILE` and `SOKAR_MATRIX_TLS_VERIFY`**, so an
  inherited value never outweighs what the project configured.
- **Run again, each keeps what exists.** `retire` twice is harmless, and so is `clear`: it says what it
  removed and what it could not, with why, exits 0, and the second time finds nothing. Sokar removes its
  own entries for the transport beside it. A project cleared can be set up again.
- **`--loopback-only`**, for an offline project: a `homeserver` that is not loopback is refused (78)
  before any request.
- **A homeserver that is not this machine's own** needs `SOKAR_MATRIX_REGISTRATION_TOKEN`.
- **The project's room is taken only if it is Sokar's:** made by its administrator, invite-only, guests
  forbidden. A room under the alias that is anybody else's, or was opened since, is refused (78) by
  `setup`, `enroll` and `join`, and `clear` leaves it and its members alone.
- **Never a second administrator:** an `@sokar` Sokar holds no token for is refused (78). If its token is
  refused and no `@sokar` exists, the homeserver was reset (78, saying so).
- Names are lower-case letters, digits and `. _ = -`; a person's may not begin with `sokar`.

## Messages

| Verb | What it does |
|---|---|
| `describe` | Prints what the transport is, reading nothing: scheme `matrix`, `poll`, `confirms: read`, `max_bytes: 10240`, `shown: true`, `persons: true`, `direct: true`, `waits: true`, `mention: true`, `display: true`, its credential and its lifecycle verbs |
| `check` | Whether it could work now: the configuration complete, the homeserver answering, the token accepted. 0 usable, 2 not |
| `send <file> <sig> --to <room id \| @user:server> [--shown <line>] [--mention @user:server]...` | To a person's user id: into the acting account's direct chat with them, opened (invite-only, marked direct) if there is none. One `m.text` event: the message in `org.fuin.sokar.message`, the signature in `org.fuin.sokar.signature`, and as its `body`, what a client shows, the line `--shown` names. In a room, each `--mention` is named in `m.mentions` and shown as a pill, by the name that person's or task's account shows, before the line, so that person's client highlights it; without one, `m.mentions` is empty and the message notifies nobody. In a direct chat nobody is mentioned. Prints `{"reference":"<event id>"}`. A retry is the same event |
| `rename --display <nickname>` | Run with a task's token: the name its account shows in the room and its direct chats becomes the nickname. Its id, its token and every address stay. Prints nothing |
| `poll --into <dir> [--persons \| --direct] [--wait <s>]` | Writes every new Sokar message as `<time>--matrix-<uuid>.json` with its `.sig` and its `.sender` (the account that sent it, as the homeserver says), each file whole, from `org.fuin.sokar.message`. With `--persons`, a person's text in the room too, as `<time>--matrix-person-<uuid>.json`, no `.sig`. With `--direct`, run with a task's token: only its direct chats with people, as person files marked `direct`. With `--wait` (1 to 30 s), the homeserver holds the sync open and it answers as soon as a message to hand over arrives; an answer with nothing in it, such as a read receipt the homeserver woke for, does not end the wait. Anything else is skipped and named on stderr |
| `receipt <reference> --by <account>` | `{"state":"read","at":…}`, `{"state":"delivered"}` or `{"state":"unknown"}` |
| `read <reference>` | Posts the account's read receipt, so the sender's `receipt` answers `read`. The reference is the event id or the file name `poll` gave, less `.json` |

- **A message over `max_bytes` is refused** (65), whatever it holds; so is one that is not UTF-8.
- **The line is Sokar's**, made on the host from the checked message: sender, addressee and text. The
  transport carries it unread, and cuts it where the event would not fit, ending "… (cut; N characters in
  all)"; the message is never cut. Without `--shown` the body is "A Sokar message.", never the message.
- **An event without `org.fuin.sokar.message`**, the message in its body as before, is not delivered.
- **A person's file** is `{"sender", "to": [...], "body", "eventId", "replyTo"?, "direct"?, "at"}`.
  - **Its `to`** is whom it is meant for, as Matrix states it: the accounts the client marked as mentioned
    (`m.mentions`, else `matrix.to` links), plus the sender of the message it replies to, less the writer
    and the poller. It may be `[]`. Every task reads the room, so who reads it is Sokar's, not `to`'s.
  - **In a direct chat**, `to` is the task's own account and `direct` is `true`.
  - **Not handed over:** notices, edits, and anything not text.
- **A direct chat is taken only from somebody who shares a room with the task's account**, the project's
  room. Any other invitation is declined and named on stderr. Which rooms are direct chats is the
  account's `m.direct`, as for every client.
- **An encrypted chat is declined, with a reason the person's client shows**: a task holds no keys and
  could never read it. nheko and Element encrypt a chat they open by default, so the person opens it
  again with encryption off. An encrypted message in any room is named on stderr, never lost silently.
- **`poll` saves its position only after the files are written**: a crash delivers a message twice,
  never skips one. One poll per account at a time (75 for a second).
- **A position from an earlier database is refused** (78): `poll` keeps the rooms beside its position
  and stops when the account is in none of them.

## Exit codes

`check` answers 0 or 2. For the other verbs, 0 is done and 75 is temporary - Sokar keeps the message and
tries again; every other code refuses it.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Done |
| 64 | Arguments not in the contract's shape |
| 65 | The message cannot be carried: not UTF-8, or too large |
| 75 | Temporary: the homeserver unreachable or busy, or another poll running |
| 76 | An answer the transport does not understand, or a redirect |
| 77 | Refused by the homeserver: the token, or a room the account is not in |
| 78 | The configuration: missing, unknown, an untrusted certificate, a reset homeserver |

The reason goes to stderr, and never contains a token.
